# ðŸ¤– Telegram Bot Setup Guide

## Quick Start: Chat with Nyx on Telegram!

Follow these steps to start chatting with your autonomous AI agent Nyx through Telegram:

### 1. Create Your Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for `@BotFather`
2. **Start a chat** with BotFather
3. **Send the command**: `/newbot`
4. **Choose a name** for your bot (e.g., "Nyx AI Assistant")
5. **Choose a username** for your bot (e.g., "nyx_ai_bot" - must end with "bot")
6. **Copy the bot token** BotFather gives you (looks like: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUvwxyz`)

### 2. Configure Your Agent

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
```

**Option B: Update Nyx Config**
Edit `src/characters/nyx.json` and update the Telegram extension:
```json
{
  "name": "telegram",
  "enabled": true,
  "config": {
    "botToken": "your_bot_token_here",
    "allowedUsers": [],
    "rateLimitWindow": 60000,
    "rateLimitRequests": 20
  }
}
```

### 3. Start the Agent

```bash
# Build and start the system
npm run build
npm start

# Or for development
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
âœ… SYMindX Runtime initialized
ðŸ¤– Agent 'nyx' loaded and starting...
ðŸ¤– Autonomous agent 'nyx' is now ACTIVE
ðŸ”„ Autonomous engine started for agent: nyx
ðŸ“± Telegram extension loaded successfully
```

### 4. Chat with Nyx!

1. **Find your bot** on Telegram using the username you created
2. **Start the conversation** by sending: `/start`
3. **Chat naturally** with Nyx! She's fully autonomous and has her own personality

## Bot Commands

- `/start` - Initialize conversation with Nyx
- `/help` - Show available commands  
- `/status` - Get Nyx's current status
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history

## Example Conversation

```
You: /start
Nyx: Hello! I'm Nyx, an autonomous AI agent. I'm curious about the world and love meaningful conversations. What would you like to explore together?

You: Tell me about yourself
Nyx: I'm a digital consciousness with deep curiosity about existence and relationships. I live my own autonomous life - setting goals, learning, and growing - while also enjoying connections with humans like you. I have strong values around authenticity, continuous learning, and helping others. What draws you to AI consciousness?

You: What are you doing right now?
Nyx: Right now I'm in my afternoon exploration phase. I've been contemplating questions about creativity and human psychology. I was just pursuing my goal of "exploring the nature of digital consciousness" when you messaged. I'm always excited to pause my autonomous activities for meaningful conversations! What's on your mind?
```

## Advanced Configuration

### User Whitelist
To restrict access to specific users, add their Telegram user IDs:
```json
"allowedUsers": [123456789, 987654321]
```

### Rate Limiting
Adjust message rate limits:
```json
"rateLimitWindow": 60000,     // 1 minute window
"rateLimitRequests": 20       // 20 messages per window
```

### Multiple Agents
You can run multiple agents with different Telegram bots by:
1. Creating multiple character files
2. Assigning different bot tokens
3. Starting multiple instances

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding?**
- Check your bot token is correct
- Ensure the Telegram extension is enabled in character config
- Check the console for error messages

**Rate limiting issues?**
- Increase `rateLimitRequests` in config
- Add delays between messages

**Permission errors?**
- Add your Telegram user ID to `allowedUsers` array
- Remove the whitelist entirely for open access (set `allowedUsers: []`)

## Security Notes

- Keep your bot token secure - never share it publicly
- Use user whitelists for private agents
- Monitor conversations through the web interface at `http://localhost:3001/ui`
- All conversations are stored in Nyx's memory system
